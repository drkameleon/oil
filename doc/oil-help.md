Oil Help
========

This doc describes every aspect of Oil briefly.  It underlies the `help`
builtin, and is indexed by keywords.

Navigate it with the [index of Oil help topics](oil-help-topics.html).

<!--
IMPORTANT: This doc is processed in TWO WAYS.  Be careful when editing.

It generates both HTML and text for the 'help' builtin.

### Usage

This section describes how to use the Oil binary.

<h4 id="oil-usage"><code>bin/oil</code> Usage</h4>

    Usage: oil  [OPTION]... SCRIPT [ARG]...
           oil [OPTION]... -c COMMAND [ARG]...

`bin/oil` is the same as `bin/osh` with a the `oil:all` option group set.  So
`bin/oil` also accepts shell flags.

    oil -c 'echo hi'
    oil myscript.oil
    echo 'echo hi' | oil

<h4 id="bundle-usage">App Bundle Usage</h4>

    Usage: oil.ovm MAIN_NAME [ARG]...
           MAIN_NAME [ARG]...

oil.ovm behaves like busybox.  If it's invoked through a symlink, e.g. 'osh',
then it behaves like that binary.  Otherwise, the binary name can be passed as
the first argument, e.g.:

    oil.ovm osh -c 'echo hi'

<h3>Oil Lexing</h3>

<h4 id="single-command">single-command</h4>

The %%% prefix Starts a Single Command Over Multiple Lines (?)

This special lexer mode has several use cases:

Long command lines without trailing \

    %%% chromium-browser
        --no-proxy-server
        # comments allowed
        --incognito

Long pipelines or and-or chains without trailing \ 

    %%% find .
        # exclude tests
      | grep -v '_test.py'
      | xargs wc -l
      | sort -n

    %%% ls /
     && ls /bin
     && ls /lib
     || error "oops"

<h2 id="command">Command Language</h2>

#### proc

Procs are shell-like functions, but with named parameters, and without dynamic
scope (TODO):

    proc copy(src, dest) {
      cp --verbose --verbose $src $dest
    }

Compare with [sh-func]($osh-help).

#### equal

The `=` keyword evaluates an expression and shows the result:

    oil$ = 1 + 2*3
    (Int)   7

It's meant to be used interactively.  Think of it as an assignment with no
variable on the left.

#### underscore

The `_` keyword evaluates an expression and throws away the result:

    var x = %(one two)
    _ push(x, 'three')

Think of it as a shortcut for `_ = expr` (throwaway assignment).

#### oil-block

Blocks can be passed to builtins (and procs eventually):

    cd /tmp {
      echo $PWD  # prints /tmp
    }
    echo $PWD

Compare with [sh-block]($osh-help).

<h2 id="assign">Assigning Variables</h2>

#### const 

Initializes a constant name to the Oil expression on the right.

    const c = 'mystr'        # equivalent to readonly c=mystr
    const pat = / digit+ /   # an eggex, with no shell equivalent

It's either a global constant or scoped to the current function.

#### var

Initializes a name to the Oil expression on the right.

    var s = 'mystr'        # equivalent to declare s=mystr
    var pat = / digit+ /   # an eggex, with no shell equivalent

It's either global or scoped to the current function.

#### setvar

Like shell's `x=1`, `setvar x = 1` either:

- Mutates an existing variable (e.g. declared with `var`)
- Creates a new **global** variable.

It's meant for interactive use and to easily convert existing shell scripts.

New Oil programs should use `set`, `setglobal`, or `setref` instead of
`setvar`.

#### setglobal

Mutates a global variable.  If it doesn't exist, the shell exits with a fatal
error.

#### setref

Mutates a variable through a named reference.  TODO: Show an example.

#### setlocal

Mutates an existing variable in the current scope.  If it doesn't exist, the
shell exits with a fatal error.

`set` is an alias for `setlocal` in the Oil language.  Requires `shopt -s
parse_set`, because otherwise, it would conflict with the `set` builtin.  Use
`builtin set -- 1 2 3` to get the builtin, or `shopt -o` to change options.


<h2 id="word">Word Language</h2>

#### inline-call

#### splice

#### expr-sub

<h2 id="expr">Oil Expression Language</h2>

### Literals

#### oil-numbers

    var myint = 42
    var myfloat = 3.14
    var float2 = 1e100

#### oil-string

Oil strings appear in expression contexts, and look like shell strings:

    var s = 'foo'
    var double = "hello $world and $(hostname)"

However, strings with backslashes are forced to specify whether they're **raw**
strings or C-style strings:

    var s = 'line\n'    # parse error: ambiguous

    var s = c'line\n'   # C-style string
    var s = $'line\n'   # also accepted for compatibility

    var s = r'[a-z]\n'  # raw strings are useful for regexes (not eggexes)

    var unicode = 'mu = \u{3bc}'

#### char-literal

    #'a'   #'_'   \n   \\   \u{3bc}

#### bool-literal

Capital letters like Python, which avoids confusion with the builtin
**commands** `true` and `false`:

    True   False

And the value that's unequal to any other:

    None   null    # JSON style also accepted

It's preferable to use the empty string in many cases.  The `None` value can't
be interpolated into words.

#### list-literal

Lists have a Python-like syntax:

    var mylist = ['one', 'two', 3]

And a shell-like syntax:

    var list2 = %(one two)

The shell-like syntax accepts the same syntax that a command can:

    ls $mystr @ARGV *.py {foo,bar}@example.com

    # Rather than executing ls, evaluate and store words
    var cmd = %(ls $mystr @ARGV *.py {foo,bar}@example.com)

#### dict-literal

    {name: 'value'}

### Operators

#### concat

    var s = 's'
    var concat1 = s ++ '_suffix'
    var concat2 = "${s}_suffix"  # similar

    var c = %(one two)
    var concat3 = c ++ %(three 4)
    var concat4 = %( @c three 4 )

    var mydict = {a: 1, b: 2}
    var otherdict = {a: 10, c: 20}
    var concat5 = mydict ++ otherdict


#### oil-compare

    a == b        # Python-like equality, no type conversion
    3 ~== 3.0     # True, type conversion
    3 ~== '3'     # True, type conversion
    3 ~== '3.0'   # True, type conversion

#### oil-logical

    not  and  or

#### oil-arith

    +  -  *  /   //   %   **

#### oil-bitwise

    ~  &  |  ^

#### oil-ternary

Like Python:

    display = 'yes' if len(s) else 'empty'

#### oil-index

Like Python:

    myarray[3]
    mystr[3]

TODO: Does string indexing give you an integer back?

#### oil-slice

Like Python:

    myarray[1 : -1]
    mystr[1 : -1]

#### func-call

Like Python:

    f(x, y)

#### block-expr

    var myblock = &(echo $PWD)

### Eggex

#### re-literal

#### re-compound

#### re-primitive

#### named-class

#### class-literal

#### re-flags

#### re-multiline

Not implemented.

#### re-glob-ops

Not implemented.

<h2 id="builtin">Builtin Commands</h2>

### Oil Builtins

#### oil-cd

It takes a block:

    cd / {
      echo $PWD
    }

#### oil-shopt

It takes a block:

    shopt --unset errexit {
      false
      echo 'ok'
    }

#### fork

The preferred alternative to shell's `&`.

    fork { sleep 1 }
    wait -n

#### forkwait

The preferred alternative to shell's `()`.  Prefer `cd` with a block if possible.

    forkwait {
      not_mutated=zzz
    }
    echo $not_mutated

#### pp

Pretty prints interpreter state.  Some of these are implementation details,
subject to change.

Examples:

    pp proc  # print all procs and their doc comments

    var x = %(one two)
    pp .cell x  # print a cell, which is a location for a value

The `.cell` action starts with `.` to indicate that its format is unstable.

#### write

    write -- @strs

#### oil-read

    read --line        # default var is $_line
    read --line --qsn  # decode QSN too
    read --all         # whole file including newline; var is $_all
		read -0            # read until NUL, synonym for read -r -d ''

#### status

Re-enable errexit.

    status --nonzero
    status --ok

### Data Formats

### External Lang

### Testing

<h2 id="option">Shell Options</h2>

### Option Groups

<!-- note: explicit anchor necessary because of mangling -->
<h4 id="strict:all">strict:all</h4>

Option in this group disallows problematic or confusing shell constructs.  The
resulting script will still run in another shell.

    shopt --set strict:all  # turn on all options
    shopt -p strict:all     # print their current state

<h4 id="oil:basic">oil:basic</h4>

Options in this group enable Oil features that are less likely to break
existing shell scripts.

For example, `parse_at` means that `@myarray` is now the operation to splice
an array.  This will break scripts that expect `@` to be literal, but you can
simply quote it like `'@literal'` to fix the problem.

    shopt --set oil:basic   # turn on all options
    shopt -p oil:basic      # print their current state

<h4 id="oil:all">oil:all</h4>

Enable the full Oil language.  This includes everything in the `oil:basic`
group.

    shopt --set oil:all     # turn on all options
    shopt -p oil:all        # print their current state

### Strictness

#### strict_tilde

Failed tilde expansions cause hard errors (like zsh) rather than silently
evaluating to `~` or `~bad`.

#### strict_word_eval

TODO

#### strict_nameref

When `strict_nameref` is set, undefined references produce fatal errors:

    declare -n ref
    echo $ref  # fatal error, not empty string
    ref=x      # fatal error instead of decaying to non-reference

References that don't contain variables also produce hard errors:

    declare -n ref='not a var'
    echo $ref  # fatal
    ref=x      # fatal

#### parse_ignored

For compatibility, Oil will parse some constructs it doesn't execute, like:

    return 0 2>&1  # redirect on control flow

When this option is disabled, that statement is a syntax error.

### Oil Basic

#### simple_word_eval

TODO:

<!-- See doc/simple-word-eval.html -->

### Oil Breaking

#### copy_env

#### parse_equals

<h2 id="special">Special Variables</h2>

#### ARGV

Replacement for `"$@"`

#### STATUS

TODO: Do we need this in expression mode?

    if ($? == 0) {
    }
    if (STATUS == 0) {
    }

#### M

TODO: The match

### Platform

#### OIL_VERSION

The version of Oil that is being run, e.g. `0.9.0`.

TODO: comparison algorithm.

<h2 id="lib">Oil Libraries</h2>

### Collections

#### len()

- `len(mystr)` is its length in bytes
- `len(myarray)` is the number of elements
- `len(assocarray)` is the number of pairs

`copy()`:

```
var d = {name: value}

var alias = d  # illegal, because it can create ownership problems
               # reference cycles
var new = copy(d)  # valid
```

### Pattern

    _match()   _start()   _end()

### String

### Better Syntax

These functions give better syntax to existing shell constructs.

- `shquote()` for `printf %q` and `${x@Q}`
- `lstrip()` for `${x#prefix}` and  `${x##prefix}`
- `rstrip()` for `${x%suffix}` and  `${x%%suffix}` 
- `lstripglob()` and `rstripglob()` for slow, legacy glob
- `upper()` for `${x^^}`
- `lower()` for `${x,,}`
- `strftime()`: hidden in `printf`

### Arrays

- `index(A, item)` is like the awk function

### Assoc Arrays

- `@names()`
- `values()`.  Problem: these aren't all strings?

### Block

<h3>libc</h3>

<h4 id="strftime">strftime()</h4>

Useful for logging callbacks.  NOTE: bash has this with the obscure printf
'%(...)' syntax.

### Hashing
